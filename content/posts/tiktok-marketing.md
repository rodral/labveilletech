# How new marketing strategies are changing the way we consume content and interact with brands

## TikTok tour guide

Roger311, a popular Chinese TikToker, visits a functional beverage factory created by his college senior classmates. The factory boasts a modern design, featuring a colorful entrance with art inspired by the renowned KAWS statues. Roger was impressed with the efforts to create a work environment that rivals those of Silicon Valley companies, and described the factory as a children's playground that was more stylish than his own home.

In this tour, Roger takes viewers on a tour of the factory, showcasing the production line that creates gel drinks, the office area, and the showroom. He also highlights the beliefs and values of the company, as evident in the typical sanctuary dedicated to Guangong, Guanyin, and the God of Wealth. Although the visit wasn't sponsored, the video provides a unique and engaging look at the functional beverage factory and the creativity and innovation that goes into making the products.

## The new marketing wave

The type of content shown in this TikTok video is an example of "natural" marketing, which refers to the use of organic, authentic, and non-intrusive methods to promote a product or brand. Natural marketing allows companies to reach their target audience in a subtle and relatable way, without the use of traditional advertising methods such as TV commercials or billboards.

In this case, the video provides a unique and engaging look at the functional beverage factory, showcasing its modern design, innovative production line, and creative work environment. The video also highlights the company's beliefs and values, which can help to establish a connection with potential customers who share similar values.

## Brand trust

Furthermore, this type of content on TikTok can help to build trust and credibility with the target audience, as it is not a direct commercial but rather an organic showcase of the company and its products. This can lead to more positive brand recognition and a higher likelihood of purchasing among the target audience.

Natural marketing strategies like the one demonstrated in this TikTok video can be an effective way for companies to reach their target audience and promote their brand in a more relatable and authentic way.
