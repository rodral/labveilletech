# Why Focusing on Usefulness is More Important Than Focusing on User Experience

In the era of digital transformation, businesses are consistently trying to distinguish themselves through the creation of unique, user-centered products. The concept of User Experience (UX) has taken center stage as a key to digital success. However, usefulness—fulfilling a user's actual needs—has emerged as an essential consideration that may outweigh UX in terms of creating truly lasting, valuable products.

##Striking the Balance: UX versus Usefulness

A common misunderstanding is that UX and usefulness are always interlinked. However, a product may offer a delightful user experience yet fail to serve a practical, functional purpose. The challenge is, therefore, to strike a balance—focus on both UX and usefulness—with a heavier emphasis on the latter.

It's important to note that a useful product tends to naturally result in a positive user experience, as it effectively meets user needs. Conversely, a product solely focused on providing an attractive UX, yet failing to deliver substantial functionality, risks becoming an empty, aesthetic shell.

##From Theory to Practice: Companies Emphasizing Usefulness

Take Amazon, for instance. This e-commerce giant's success story has been centered around the idea of usefulness from its very beginning. Amazon has created a user experience that, although simple, serves its primary purpose efficiently—providing a vast array of products with a reliable delivery system. Over the years, Amazon has enhanced its UX, but the core focus on usefulness remains unaltered.

Similarly, Google's straightforward interface belies its deeply ingrained commitment to usefulness. It's Google's ability to provide useful, accurate search results that has made it a daily necessity for millions, more so than its user experience.

##The Essential Takeaway

In essence, usefulness should take precedence in the product development process. Companies that prioritize usefulness invariably stand a higher chance of crafting products that not only satisfy their users' needs but also stand the test of time. By concentrating on what users genuinely require, businesses can offer not just an aesthetically pleasing interface, but also a purposeful, practical tool. Thus, great UX becomes a natural outcome of a useful product, rather than its focal point.
