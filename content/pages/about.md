# Who am I?

## Entering the Digital World

As a global citizen, I was born in the United States but raised in Switzerland. Growing up in a technologically advanced society sparked a passion in me for understanding the ways in which technology is shaping our world. Now, at the age of 25, I am excited to be graduating with my Bachelorâ€™s degree in September and eager to apply my knowledge and skills to make an impact in the field!

## My background

With a strong IT foundation, I have found my calling in combining creativity and communication to bring a fresh and innovative approach to media engineering and marketing. My technical background gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to create impactful and effective marketing strategies that drive positive change in the industry. I am learning skills over time, and my knowledge in both technical and creative domains enable me to deliver innovative solutions that will help businesses reach their full potential through strategic communication and marketing tactics. My goal is to continue sharpening my skills and getting experience to push the boundaries of traditional marketing and drive innovation in the industry, using data-driven approaches, emerging technologies, and user-centric design.

## My Ikigai

Ikigai is a Japanese concept that refers to a person's reason for being, their source of happiness and fulfillment. It is often described as the intersection of four key elements: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. By finding and pursuing one's Ikigai, it is believed that a person can achieve a sense of purpose and meaning in their life. This is what mine looks like.
