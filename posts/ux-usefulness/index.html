<h2 id=the-importance-of-balancing-ux-and-usefulness>The Importance of Balancing UX and Usefulness</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced digital world, businesses are constantly looking for ways to stand out and offer valuable products to their users. While user experience (UX) is often touted as the key to success, a new perspective suggests that focusing on usefulness is even more crucial. In this article, we will explore why prioritizing usefulness is the key to creating truly valuable products that stand the test of time.</p>
<h2 id=the-need-for-focus-on-usefulness>The Need for Focus on Usefulness</h2>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to understand that UX and usefulness are not mutually exclusive. A product can have a great user experience and still be lacking in its overall usefulness. The key is to strike a balance between the two, but with a strong emphasis on usefulness. The reason for this is that a product that is useful will naturally have a positive user experience. On the other hand, a product that focuses solely on UX may not have meaningful functionality, resulting in a product that is visually appealing but ultimately useless.</p>
<h2 id=companies-that-prioritize-usefulness>Companies That Prioritize Usefulness</h2>
<p>One example of a company that prioritizes usefulness over UX is Amazon. From its inception, Amazon has focused on providing the most useful experience possible to its users. This has resulted in a platform that offers an almost endless supply of products, from everyday household items to niche products, all delivered with lightning-fast shipping. While the platform&rsquo;s UX has improved over the years, the focus on usefulness has always remained the same.</p>
<p>Another example is Google, which revolutionized the search engine industry by providing the most useful results possible. The UX of Google is simple and straightforward, but it is the usefulness of the results that has made it the go-to search engine for millions of people. PayPal is another great example of a company that prioritizes usefulness over UX. The platform allows users to send and receive money with ease, making it a valuable tool for millions of people around the world.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while UX is important, it should be secondary to the usefulness of a product. Companies that prioritize usefulness over UX are more likely to create products that are truly valuable to their users and stand the test of time. By focusing on what users actually need, companies can create products that are not only visually appealing but also meaningful and functional. By prioritizing usefulness, companies can create products that offer a great user experience as a natural byproduct, rather than the main focus.</p>
